String is a sequence of characters that are treated as a single data item and terminated by a null character '\0'. Remember that the C language does not support strings as a data type. A string is actually a one-dimensional array of characters in C language. These are often used to create meaningful and readable programs.
// valid
char name[13] = "StudyTonight";        
char name[10] = {'c','o','d','e','\0'};      

// Illegal
char ch[3] = "hello";    
char str[4];
str = "hello";  


#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>

int main()
{
    char s1[50], s2[50];

    strcpy(s1, "StudyTonight");     
    strcpy(s2, s1);     

    printf("%s\n", s2);
    
    return(0);
